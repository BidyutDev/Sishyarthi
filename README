# College ERP System

## 📌 Overview  
Many colleges still manage admissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records with separate ledgers and redundant data entry. This leads to:  
- Long queues for students  
- Repeated manual work for staff  
- Limited visibility for administrators  

Commercial ERP suites solve these issues—but at a cost most public institutions cannot afford.  

**College ERP System** is a **lightweight, self-hosted solution** built on a **centralized database**. It ensures a **single source of truth** for student, financial, hostel, and academic records, while remaining affordable and practical.
